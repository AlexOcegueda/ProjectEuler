# Project Euler

## Description

Includes a math library for common utility functions which will be used in many Project Euler questions. 
Each solution can be ran by the Makefile for easy compilation and execution.

## Why I made this

Made this to learn number theory with programming languages I rarely get to use. 

## Languages Used

- C
- C#

## Favorite Problems

- Problem 11: This has you check in all directions for a 20x20 grid for the largest product. I am very proud of my solution as I made it dynamic so you can put in any size multidimensional array along with any number of numbers to check for the product.

The problem gives a 20x20 with only checking 4 numbers, but with my function you can put a 1x1 checking 1+ numbers.

Example: (10x10, 2), (12x12, 8), (200x200, 50).
